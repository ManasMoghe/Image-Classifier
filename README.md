# 🐱🐶 Cat vs Dog Image Classifier

This project is a simple web application built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained in TensorFlow/Keras to classify uploaded images as either **Cat** or **Dog**.

## 🚀 Demo

Upload any `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png` image of a cat or dog, and the app will predict the correct category with a confidence score.
